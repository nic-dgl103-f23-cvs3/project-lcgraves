            <h2>The Stages at MusicFest</h2>
            <p>Vancouver Island MusicFest isn't just about the music; it's about the vibe and the places where the magic
                unfolds. Each stage has its own unique charm and as you journey from stage to stage, you'll find
                yourself transported to entirely new realms.</p>

                <h3>The Concert Bowl Stage</h3>
                <p>Our evening's main stage plays host to larger-than-life sessions and extraordinary events. Picture
                    choirs, big bands, dance performances, and remarkable collaborations where visiting performers
                    unite,
                    creating unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experiences.</p>

                <h3>The Grierson Stage</h3>
                <p>The Grierson Stage is where the musical alchemy happens, named in honor of our Festival M.C.,
                    David Grierson. It's all about spontaneous jams, themed song circles, and a whole lot of musical
                    wizardry. Get ready for those impromptu sparks of genius!</p>

                <h3>The Grassy Knoll</h3>
                <p>Every artist gets their time in the spotlight, and the Grassy Knoll is where it all goes down.
                    Imagine a beautiful mini-amphitheater surrounded by nature where bands strut their stuff. It's
                    where the sound meets the soul.</p>

                <h3>The Woodland Stage</h3>
                <p>Tucked away in our mystical forest, the Woodland Stage is where singer-songwriters and solo acts
                    rock the scene. It's intimate, it's raw, and it's where the music gets personal. Mother Nature's
                    the backdrop, and the vibes are electric.</p>

                <h3>The Barn</h3>
                <p>The Barn is the cool hangout spot. Whether it's movies, square dances, or wild workshops, it's
                    where you find shelter from the elements (rain or shine). Plus, it's the spot for dancing and
                    jamming with visiting performers. The energy here is off the charts!</p>

                <h3>The Crossroads</h3>
                <p>Our daytime stage is a knowledge hub with a twist. Get hands-on, dive into presentations, and
                    explore everything from harmony singing to wicked guitar riffs. It's where legends share their
                    secrets, and you might even co-write a hit with your musical heroes.</p>
